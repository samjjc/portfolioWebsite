I'm a 2nd year software engineering student at Carleton and I'm about to start interning as an ETL developer at [Fullscript](https://fullscript.com) 

I enjoy building things with **Go**, **Kotlin**, **Python**, and **Ruby** and am always looking to learn about new tools. Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to improve the daily lives of people around me. I love solving problems related to performance and scalability and I like to focus on keeping my code maintainable and simple.

I am currently looking for an internship for Summer ~~2019~~ 2020. If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me at [sam111jc@gmail.com](mailto:sam111jc@gmail.com).
