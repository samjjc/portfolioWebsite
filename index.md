I'm a 2nd year software engineering student at Carleton and I'm about to start interning as an ETL developer at [Fullscript](https://fullscript.com) 

I enjoy building things with **Go**, **Kotlin**, **Python**, and **Ruby**. But of course, these are just tools and I'm always learning new things. I'm passionate about using technology to improve the daily lives of people around me. I love solving problems related to performance and scalability and care deeply about keeping my code maintainable and simple.

When I'm not coding, I can be found playing or watching basketball (Go Raptors!!) or streaming an LCS game (mainly Echo Fox games).
